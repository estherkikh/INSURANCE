Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a process of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. EDA was initially used in the context of statistical graphics and is now used in the context of data visualization, machine learning, and data mining.

The goal of EDA is to explore the data, identify patterns, discover relationships, and develop insights into the data set. To accomplish this, various data visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, correlation plots, and others are used. Additionally, summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles are used to provide an overview of the data set.

For the given dataset on insurance, EDA will involve:

1. Investigating the distributions of the various features in the dataset. 

2. Examining the correlations between the features and the target variable. 

3. Examining the trends and patterns in the data.

4. Identifying any outliers or unusual observations in the data. 

5. Examining the relationships between the features.

Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a statistical method used for predicting a continuous outcome variable from one or more predictor variables. It is a supervised machine learning technique that builds a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.

For the given dataset on insurance, linear regression can be used to train the data and obtain evaluation aspects in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MSE. MAE (Mean Absolute Error) measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) measures the average magnitude of the errors of a set of predictions, taking into account their direction. MSE (Mean Squared Error) measures the average of the squares of the errors in a set of predictions.

In order to use linear regression to train the data, we will need to first split the dataset into training and test sets. We will then use the training set to fit a linear regression model. We can then use the model to make predictions on the test set, and evaluate the model using the MAE, RMSE, and MSE metrics.
